Artwork Fetcher Plugin for Sketch
=============

Sketch.app plugin for fetching artworks from Last.fm web-service and filling selected shapes with them. Allows to fetch artworks by their album and/or artist names.

Initially, the plugin was developed to fulfil our own needs at [Semibold Mammoth](http://mmth.us) when we designed [Simplify for Mac](http://mmth.us/simplify) and its [Tape.im](http://tape.im) web-service.

## Demo

## Usage
1. Select at least one shape you want to fill with an artwork
2. Navigate the menu bar and select `Plugins ▸ Artwork Fetcher ▸ Fetch Artworks From Last.fm`

**Keyboard Shortcut**
The default command bind for adding artworks to all selected shapes is:
`Control` + `Command` + `L`

**Usage Notes**  
Last.fm API allows to fetch no more than 50 artworks. Anyway, downloading more than 10–15 artworks at a time can cause complete freezing of Sketch. It depends on your Internet broadband and performance of your Mac.

It worth mentioning that the plugin works only with Sketch 3.1 and newer.

2. Navigate the Sketch menu bar to `Plugins ▸ Reveal Plugins Folder…`
